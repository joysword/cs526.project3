	"""
	The Dungeon class.


	Dungeon( (grid_size_x, grid_size_y),
			 name,
			 max_num_rooms,
			 min_room_size,
			 max_room_size,
			 (tile_w, tile_h) )

	(grid_size_x, grid_size_y)
		- the total size/area of the map in tiles.
			e.g. (25, 20) would set the map to be 25 tiles wide and 20 tall.

	name
		- the name of the dungeon

	max_num_rooms
		- the maximum number of rooms for the dungeon to contain.

	min_room_size
		- the minimum size for each room.
			e.g. (3, 3) would set the minimum room size to 3 tiles by 3 tiles.

	max_room_size
		- the maximum size for each room.
			e.g. (7, 7) would set the maximum room size to 7 tiles by 7 tiles.

	(tile_w, tile_h)
		- the size of the tiles in pixels.



	Misc Information:

		-self.grid is the most important variable in this whole file. It is a 2
		dimensional list that stores the entire map and layout of the dungeon.
		Each number in the list represents a tile in the dungeon.
			0 = blank space (non-useable)
			1 = floor tile (walkable)
			2 = corner tile (non-useable)
			3 = wall tile on NORTH.

			773 = door tile right NORTh
			74 = door tile left EAST
			774 = door tile right EAST
			75 = door tile left SOUTH
			775 = door tile right SOUTH
			76 = door tile left WEST
			776 = door tile right WEST
			8 = stairs leading to a higher level in the dungeon.
			9 = stairs leading to a lower level in the dungeon.
			10 = chest
			11 = path from up to down staircases (floor tile)
			13 = channel to NORTH
			14 = channel to EAST
			15 = channel to SOUTH
			16 = channel to WEST
			23 = torch on NORTH
			24 = torch on EAST
			25 = torch on SOUTH
			26 = torch on WEST

		-self.rooms stores the Room object from the Room class, which stores
		 what tiles are room holds, the size of the room, and the coordinate
		 of the top-left tile (number) of the room. The position and size
		 variables are especially important because they are used together to
		 calculate the section of the dungeon grid we look at to pick a random
		 wall (number) to branch from in the get_branching_position() function.



	Functions:


		print_info(grid=True)
			- prints the name, size, number of rooms, and if passed 'True' for
			  the grid argument, prints the actual layout of the dungeon, all
			  to the python shell.


		generate_room((min_size_x, min_size_y), (max_size_x, max_size_y))
			- enerates a randomly sized list of numbers to represent a room.
			  (see the Room class for more details on what the numbers mean.)

			(min_size_x, min_size_y)
				- the minimum size of each room to be generated.

			(max_size_x, max_size_y)
				- the maximum size of each room to be generated.

		get_branching_position()
			- picks a random room that has been placed, then picks a random
			  (valid) wall tile (number) from the room, and returns the
			  position in the dungeon grid that it is located at. Valid walls
			  (numbers) include 3, 4, 5, 6. See the Room class for more info
			  on what the numbers actually represent.


		get_branching_direction(branching_position)
			- returns the direction the passed 'wall tile' (numbers 3, 4, 5, 6
			  in the grid list) is facing.

			branching_position
				- the coordinates of the 'wall tile' in the grid list we want
				  to find out which way is facing.


		space_for_new_room((new_room_size_x, new_room_size_y),
							new_room_position)
			- checks to see if there is space to add a given room to the
			  dungeon. Returns True if there is, False if otherwise.

			(new_room_size_x, new_room_size_y)
				- the size of the room to be checked.

			new_room_position
				- the coordinates of where the room would be. We start here,
				  then check the entire area of the grid the room covers
				  to see if it overlaps with any other rooms. If it doesn't
				  overlap with anything, return True. Otherwise return False.


		place_room(room, (grid_x, grid_y))
			- changes the grid list to add the given room to it.

			room
				- the room we want to add to the grid.

			(grid_x, grid_y)
				- the location inside the grid we want to change to add the
				  room to.


		connect_rooms(branching_pos, branching_length, direction)
			- slightly changes the grid list to connect 2 rooms. Changes the
			  wall tile, and the tile next to it in the direction it's
			  facing, both to floor tiles (1's in the grid list).

			branching_pos
				- the location of the tile we just added a room to.

			branching_length
				- the length of branchin

			direction
				- the direction the wall was facing before we added the room.

			*- think of it like this. We pick a random wall tile of a random
			   room. This is the spot we want to add another room to. After we
			   add the room to that spot, we now turn that spot from a wall tile
			   into a floor tile (e.g. a 3 into a 1), then whichever way the
			   tile was facing, we take the tile in that direction next to it
			   and also turn it into a floor tile.


		set_staircases()
			- picks a random room, then a random floor tile (a 1 in the grid
			  list) and turn it into a staircase going up (8 in the grid list).
			  Then does the same thing again, but changes the next floor tile
			  into a staircase going dowm (9 in the grid list).


		generate_dungeon()
			- uses all of the above functions, to generate a dungeon.
